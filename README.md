## Building a Portfolio to Showcase my Skill!
The first step to showchasing a potential employer my skills was to have a good skeleton ready, afterall it is how I asses the placement of things and how the decor will go.

I started off by creating the sections that will hold each portion of the assignment. 

* First section was the header: Here I placed my id for topnav which contained the links to "Contact Me", "About Me" and "Projects"

* Second section was the body: This section had the "About Me" content as well as the "Projects"

* Lastly, the footer was done. In it contained the "Contact Me" information.

After setting up the skeleton of the assignment, I went ahead with the content! Starting from the top of the page, the navigation links and the profile pic were added to the header. 
* I wanted the profile picture to be round so as to give it a more modern look. In the CSS Stylesheet I made the borders 50% to make it a perfect circle. I also placed it in the middle so as to get the attention of the prospective employer. 

* I then added the links "Contact Me" "About Me" and "Projects". 
    * I edited out the underline and text-color and gave thema centered look.
    * I linked them to the perspective portion of the page by using the linking the respective id to the href.

For the body/main section:
* I wrote a small blurb and above it I wrote my name as a h1 header so as to catch the attention of the viewer. I centered it to make it more grandiose.

* The projects were very tricky. I went back and forth between using grids and flexboxes. In the end I went with flexboxes to make it more responsive and because I feel like I am not as proficient in using grids, <u><b>YET!</b></u>

* I went with a simple box look and resized the first project to be larger than the rest while placing the last three next to each other.

LASTLY, for the footer I placed my contact information. Since it is at the bottom of the page, I wanted the first navigation button to be "Contact Me" so as to take the eyes of the viewer all throughout the page before clicking on my contact info.
